üìù Project Overview
The Distributed AI Model Training Platform is designed to train machine learning models faster by distributing the workload across multiple nodes. It uses a combination of microservices and distributed computing techniques to:

Distribute tasks among worker nodes.
Aggregate results from each node.
Monitor system performance.
Automatically scale as workload increases.
üó∫Ô∏è Architecture
The system follows a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and flexibility.
